First Download the dataset "PAKDD-3year" folder and now create a new folder named "entities" and keep all the above code files just outside to these two folders.

1) Use text.sh to produce the textfiles from the pdf in the same folder of PAKDD-3year. This file should be out of that folder.
   Format of text files : Name_of_the_pdf_text

2) After that run sent_token.py to generate a file of filtered named entities for each pdf separately. This file should also be out of the PAKDD-3year folder.
   Format : Name_of_the_pdf_entities
